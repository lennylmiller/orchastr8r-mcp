# Message 7: Documentation Organization Command

## üìù **Original Message**
> Given the root folder path: /Users/LenMiller/code/banno/orchestr8r-mcp/docs/backlog/conversation-prompts
> 
> Please perform the following tasks in order:
> 
> 1. **Identify Chat Session Theme**: Analyze our entire conversation history and determine the primary theme/topic of this chat session in 1-2 sentences.
> 
> 2. **Extract User Messages**: Create a chronological list of all user messages from this conversation, maintaining the exact content and context.
> 
> 3. **Organize by Theme**: Create a structured folder organization within the root folder based on the identified theme. Save each user message as a separate markdown file with descriptive filenames that reflect the message content.
> 
> 4. **Generate Index File**: Create a comprehensive index.md file in the root folder that includes:
>    - The identified chat session theme at the top
>    - A clickable table of contents with relative links to each message file
>    - A detailed description section explaining the conversation flow
>    - Helpful sections organizing the content by subtopics or chronological phases
> 
> File naming convention: Use descriptive names like "01-debugging-crisis-decision.md", "02-file-resave-request.md", etc.
> 
> Ensure all file paths are relative to the root folder and all markdown links are properly formatted for local file navigation.
