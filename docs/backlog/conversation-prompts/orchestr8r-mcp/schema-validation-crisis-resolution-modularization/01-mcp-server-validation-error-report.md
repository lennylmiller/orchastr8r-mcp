# MCP Server Validation Error Report

**Date**: 2025-01-31  
**Context**: orchestr8r-mcp Context Tracker v1.0 deployment  
**Issue**: All tools showing validation errors in Claude Desktop  

## Error Message

```
All tools for this MCP server have validation errors: get-project, list-projects, get-project-columns, get-project-fields, get-project-items, update-project-item-field, bulk-update-project-item-field, create-project, update-project, delete-project, copy-project, add-draft-issue, convert-draft-issue, add-item-to-project, update-item-position, delete-project-item, create-project-field, update-project-field, delete-project-field, update-project-status, archive-project-item, unarchive-project-item, clear-item-field-value, mark-project-as-template, unmark-project-as-template, get-issue, list-issues, create-issue, update-issue, set-working-context, get-working-context, transition-task-state
```

## Context

This error occurred after successfully implementing the Persistent Context Tracker v1.0, which includes:
- ✅ Context Store Service (13/13 tests passing)
- ✅ Lazy initialization fixes for GitHubClient
- ✅ Environment variable loading fixes
- ✅ MCP server startup (working correctly)

The server starts successfully but all tools fail validation in Claude Desktop, indicating a schema definition issue rather than a runtime problem.

## Impact

- Context Tracker functionality is implemented and working
- MCP server starts without errors
- All tools are inaccessible from Claude Desktop due to validation failures
- Blocks production deployment and testing of Context Tracker v1.0

## Next Steps

Investigation needed into MCP tool schema definitions and validation requirements.
