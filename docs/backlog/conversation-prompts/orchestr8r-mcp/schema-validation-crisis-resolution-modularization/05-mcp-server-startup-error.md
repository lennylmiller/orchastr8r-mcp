# MCP Server Startup Error Report

**User Report**: 
```
I successfully rebuilt the orchestr8r-mcp project and restarted VS Code, but I'm encountering an MCP server startup error. The error message indicates two potential issues:

1. **Primary Error**: `MCP error -32603: Cannot read properties of null (reading '_def')` - This suggests a schema validation or Zod object definition issue
2. **Secondary Error**: `Starting inspector on 127.0.0.1:9229 failed: address already in use` - This indicates the debug port is already occupied

**Error Details:**
- Command: `node --inspect=9229 /Users/LenMiller/code/banno/orchestr8r-mcp/build/index.js`
- Context: This occurred after implementing the schema validation fixes (wrapping 32 schemas with z.object()) and the filesystem path resolution fix for the context persistence issue

**Questions:**
1. Could the `_def` error be related to our recent schema changes where we wrapped plain objects with `z.object()`?
2. Is this error preventing the context persistence fix from being tested?
3. Should I kill the existing debug process on port 9229, or use a different approach to start the MCP server?

Please help diagnose whether this is a schema validation regression from our recent fixes, a build issue, or a port conflict, and provide specific steps to resolve it so we can continue testing the 32 schema validation fixes.
```

**Critical Issue**: The `_def` error suggests a Zod schema is null/undefined, potentially indicating a regression from the schema fixes or an import/export issue.

**Impact**: Complete blockage of MCP server startup and testing.
