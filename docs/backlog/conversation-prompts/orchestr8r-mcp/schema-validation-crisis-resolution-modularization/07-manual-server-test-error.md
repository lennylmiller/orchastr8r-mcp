# Manual Server Test Still Shows Error

**User Report**: "i started it manually and then started claude code, and I still get the error"

**Context**: After attempting to start the server manually (outside of Claude Desktop) and then starting Claude Desktop, the same `_def` error persists.

**Significance**: This confirms that the error is not related to Claude Desktop's startup process but is inherent in the server code itself.

**Implication**: The issue is in the built server code, likely in the schema definitions or tool registration process, not in the startup environment or configuration.
