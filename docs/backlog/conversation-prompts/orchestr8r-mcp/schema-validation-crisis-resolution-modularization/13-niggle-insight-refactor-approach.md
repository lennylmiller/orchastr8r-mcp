# The Niggle Insight - Refactor Approach

**User Statement**: 
```
Ok, I have a niggle, and it goes like this... the very first time I analyzed this and we were talking about refactory index.js see docs/development/roadmap.md...   could we commit this branch, have you look at the parent branch and maybe start with a refactor and then apply what this bran... don't do anything we're ideating right now,   does that make sense?
```

**Key Insight**: User's intuition ("niggle") that the current approach may be flawed. The original plan was to refactor/modularize index.js first (as noted in the roadmap), but instead we jumped directly into implementing schema fixes and context tracker features.

**Proposed Alternative Approach**:
1. Commit current branch (preserve all work done)
2. Return to parent branch (known working state)
3. Start with refactoring/modularizing index.js (original roadmap item)
4. Then incrementally apply the changes from the current branch

**Rationale**: The current tangled state with multiple simultaneous changes makes debugging extremely difficult. A systematic, incremental approach might be more effective.

**Status**: Ideation phase - considering strategic reset vs. continued debugging.
