# Multiple AI Agents Investigation Request

**User Statement**: 
```
I'm having a. couple different AI Agents look to see if they can find the following bug you've been unable to fix:  Failed to start the MCP server. {"command":"node --inspect=9229 /Users/LenMiller/code/banno/orchestr8r-mcp/build/index.js","args":[],"error":"MCP error -32603: Cannot read properties of null (reading '_def')","stderr":"Starting inspector on 127.0.0.1:9229 failed: address already in use\n"}
```

**Context**: After extensive debugging attempts with one AI agent, user decided to engage multiple AI agents to get fresh perspectives on the persistent `_def` error.

**Strategy**: Collaborative debugging approach using multiple AI agents to:
1. Examine the problem from different angles
2. Identify potential issues that may have been missed
3. Provide alternative debugging strategies
4. Leverage diverse problem-solving approaches

**Status**: Seeking additional expertise to resolve the complex schema validation issue.
