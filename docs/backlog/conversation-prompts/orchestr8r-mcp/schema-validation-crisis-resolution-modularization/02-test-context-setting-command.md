# Test Context Setting Command

**User Request**: 
```
typed `get the current context state` and got "I'll retrieve the current working context for you. This will show you any active project, issue, or task state that's currently set.The current working context shows the following state:

**No Active Project or Issue**
Right now, there's no specific GitHub project or issue selected as your current focus. Both the `currentProjectId` and `currentIssueId` are null, which means you're working in a general context rather than being focused on a particular project item.

**Task State: Research**
Your current task state is set to "research". This is one of several possible task states that help track what phase of work you're in. The available states typically include research, implementation, testing, review, done, and blocked. Being in the "research" state suggests you're in an exploratory or information-gathering phase.

**Session Information**
You're working in session `session_1748748386382_5zyrs9uvi`, which was last updated just moments ago (at 2025-06-01T03:26:26.382Z). The context validation confirms everything is in a valid state.

This context system appears designed to help you maintain awareness of what you're working on across different tools and commands. When you have an active project and issue selected, various operations can automatically reference that context, making it easier to work without repeatedly specifying which items you're focusing on. You can update this context using the `set-working-context` function whenever you want to switch your focus to a specific project, issue, or change your task state."
