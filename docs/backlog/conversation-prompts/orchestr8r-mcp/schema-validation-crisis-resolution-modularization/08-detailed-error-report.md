# Detailed Error Report with Debug Information

**User Report**: 
```
here's the error: Failed to start the MCP server. {"command":"node --inspect=9229 /Users/LenMiller/code/banno/orchestr8r-mcp/build/index.js","args":[],"error":"MCP error -32603: Cannot read properties of null (reading '_def')","stderr":"Debugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9229/5b071878-5c02-444f-a04d-fa3612119303\nFor help, see: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector\n"}
```

**Analysis**: 
- Debug mode is still active (--inspect=9229 flag present)
- Debugger is successfully listening on port 9229
- The `_def` error is still occurring during server startup
- This suggests the issue is in the schema validation code, not the debug configuration

**Next Steps Needed**: Remove debug flag and focus on the core `_def` error in the schema definitions.
