# Context Setting Test Results

**User Report**: 
```
here are the results: I'll help you set the working context with those values. However, I notice you mentioned "in-progress" as the task state, but the system actually uses specific predefined states. Let me explain the available options and set the context with the most appropriate one.I encountered an error while trying to set the context. The system is attempting to save the context information to a directory that doesn't exist or isn't accessible (/.orchestr8r). This appears to be a filesystem permission or configuration issue.

Let me explain what was happening and what we can learn from this:

When you set a working context, the system tries to persist this information so it can maintain your current focus across different operations. Think of it like setting a bookmark - you're telling the system "I'm currently working on this specific project and issue, and I'm in this particular phase of work."

Regarding the task state you mentioned, "in-progress" isn't one of the predefined states. The system uses these specific task states:

- **research** - When you're investigating, gathering information, or exploring a problem
- **implementation** - When you're actively coding or building the solution
- **testing** - When you're verifying that your solution works correctly
- **review** - When your work is being reviewed or you're reviewing others' work
- **done** - When the task is completed
- **blocked** - When you can't proceed due to external dependencies or issues

I attempted to use "implementation" as it seemed closest to what you might mean by "in-progress" - the state where you're actively working on building something.

The error suggests there might be a configuration issue with how the context management system is set up in this environment. The directory it's trying to use (/.orchestr8r) either doesn't exist or the system doesn't have permission to create it. This would typically be resolved by ensuring the proper directory structure exists and has appropriate permissions.

Would you like to try a different approach, or shall we proceed without setting the context for now?

**Analysis**: 
- ✅ Schema validation worked correctly (caught invalid task state)
- ❌ Filesystem persistence failed (/.orchestr8r directory issue)
- Test 2 partially passed - validation working, persistence failing

**Key Issues Identified**:
1. Filesystem path resolution problem
2. Context persistence configuration issue
3. Need to fix directory creation logic
