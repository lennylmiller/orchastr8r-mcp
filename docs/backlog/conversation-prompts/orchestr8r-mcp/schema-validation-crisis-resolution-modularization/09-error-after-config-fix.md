# Error Persists After Configuration Fix

**User Report**: 
```
Failed to start the MCP server. {"command":"node /Users/LenMiller/code/banno/orchestr8r-mcp/build/index.js","args":[],"error":"MCP error -32603: Cannot read properties of null (reading '_def')","stderr":""}
```

**Context**: After updating Claude Desktop configuration to remove the debug flag (--inspect=9229), the `_def` error still persists.

**Significance**: This confirms that:
1. The debug port conflict has been resolved
2. The core issue is in the schema validation code itself
3. One or more schemas are null/undefined when the MCP server tries to access their `_def` property

**Status**: Need to identify which specific schema is causing the null reference error.
