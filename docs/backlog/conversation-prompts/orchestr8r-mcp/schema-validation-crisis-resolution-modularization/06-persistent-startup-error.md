# Persistent Startup Error After Fixes

**User Report**: 
```
Failed to start the MCP server. {"command":"node /Users/LenMiller/code/banno/orchestr8r-mcp/build/index.js","args":[],"error":"MCP error -32603: Cannot read properties of null (reading '_def')","stderr":""}
```

**Context**: After implementing multiple fixes including:
- Removing debug flag (--inspect=9229)
- Fixing import issues (type imports â†’ regular imports)
- Removing circular dependencies
- Rebuilding the project

**Status**: The `_def` error persists even after addressing the debug port conflict and other potential issues.

**Significance**: This indicates the root cause is deeper than initially suspected and may require more systematic debugging or a different approach.
