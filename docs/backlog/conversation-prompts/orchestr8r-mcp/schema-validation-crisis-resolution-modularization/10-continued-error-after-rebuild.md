# Continued Error After Rebuild and Fixes

**User Report**: 
```
Failed to start the MCP server. {"command":"node /Users/LenMiller/code/banno/orchestr8r-mcp/build/index.js","args":[],"error":"MCP error -32603: Cannot read properties of null (reading '_def')","stderr":""}

Please show me and slowly explain
```

**Context**: After multiple fix attempts including:
- Circular dependency removal
- Import/export corrections
- Repository schema fixes
- Build process completion
- Configuration updates

**User Request**: Asked for a slow, detailed explanation of what's happening and why the error persists.

**Status**: The `_def` error has proven resistant to all attempted fixes, indicating a need for systematic diagnosis rather than continued targeted fixes.
