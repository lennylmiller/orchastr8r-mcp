# Request to Get Test 2 Green

**User Request**: "No, let's get Test 2 green"

**Context**: After discovering that Test 2 (context setting) had schema validation working but filesystem persistence failing, user requested to focus on fixing the persistence issue completely rather than moving on to other tests.

**Priority**: Fix the filesystem path resolution issue in the context persistence system to make Test 2 fully pass.

**Expected Outcome**: Context setting should work without filesystem errors, allowing the context tracker to properly persist state between operations.
