# Comprehensive Handoff Prompt Request

**User Request**: 
```
I need a comprehensive handoff prompt for continuing our orchestr8r-mcp development work in a new chat session. Please create a prompt that includes:

**Context Summary:**
- Current repository state: orchestr8r-mcp with persistent `_def` MCP server startup error
- 72+ hours of debugging attempts on schema validation fixes and context tracker implementation
- Decision point: Continue complex debugging vs. reset to clean baseline with incremental approach

**Technical Details:**
- Specific error: `Cannot read properties of null (reading '_def')` during MCP server startup
- Recent changes: 34+ schema fixes (wrapping with z.object()), context tracker implementation, filesystem path resolution
- Current branch status: Has working code but tangled state making debugging difficult
- Parent branch: Known working MCP server baseline

**Key Files and Changes:**
- List the main files modified (src/operations/*.ts, src/services/context-store.ts, etc.)
- Reference the NIGGLE-ANALYSIS.md document in docs/development/
- Mention the "Modularize index.ts" roadmap item

**Immediate Decision Needed:**
- Whether to commit current branch and reset to parent branch for incremental development
- How to proceed with the recommended Phase 1-4 approach from the niggle analysis

**Context for New AI:**
- I prefer iterative development and systematic debugging approaches
- The new AI should understand this is a critical decision point requiring architectural thinking
- Reference message ID: 7fcd0872-430e-48a9-9fbe-4859567c93db for conversation continuity

Format this as a clear, actionable prompt that allows a new AI agent to immediately understand the situation and provide strategic guidance on the next steps.
```

**Purpose**: Create a comprehensive handoff document for transitioning the conversation to a new AI agent while preserving all context and decision-making information.
