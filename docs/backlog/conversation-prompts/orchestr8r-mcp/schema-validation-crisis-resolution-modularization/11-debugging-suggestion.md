# Debugging with Breakpoints Suggestion

**User Response**: "we can add debugging back and I can stop on breakpoint"

**Context**: After multiple failed attempts to fix the `_def` error through code changes, user suggested returning to debug mode to use breakpoints for systematic diagnosis.

**Approach**: Enable debug mode with breakpoints to:
1. Identify exactly which schema is null when the error occurs
2. Examine the call stack leading to the error
3. Inspect schema values during tool registration
4. Determine the root cause through step-by-step debugging

**Strategy**: Use VS Code debugger or Chrome DevTools to connect to the debug session and set strategic breakpoints in schema registration areas.
