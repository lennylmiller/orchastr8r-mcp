## üéØ **Message Type**
Clarification Request / Content Review

## üìä **Analysis**

### **Context**
After planning session continuity, the user asked for a reminder about conversation prompts worked on during the chat. This suggests:
- **Memory Management**: Tracking multiple workstreams
- **Content Verification**: Ensuring nothing was missed
- **Documentation Needs**: Preparing for knowledge transfer

### **Potential Confusion**
The user may have been thinking of different types of prompts:
- **MCP Prompts**: The 6 prompts we modularized from index.ts
- **Conversation Management Prompts**: Related to broader orchestr8r vision
- **Context Tracker Prompts**: Part of the unimplemented features

## üîÑ **Response & Clarification**

### **MCP Prompts Identified**
The response clarified that we worked on **MCP prompts** during modularization:

#### **Sprint Management Prompts:**
1. **`create-sprint-project`** - Create new Sprint/iteration projects
2. **`manage-sprint-backlog`** - Organize and prioritize issues
3. **`track-sprint-progress`** - Generate status reports with burndown metrics
4. **`prepare-sprint-retrospective`** - Create retrospective reports

#### **Project Template Prompts:**
5. **`create-project-template`** - Create reusable project templates

#### **Code Review Prompts:**
6. **`review-code`** - Simple code review prompt

### **Clarification Offered**
The response also offered to clarify if the user meant:
- **Conversation management prompts** for broader vision
- **Context tracker prompts** from unimplemented features
- **Different types of prompts** entirely

## üéØ **Strategic Significance**

The inquiry suggests preparation for:
- **Session Handoff**: Documenting all work completed

## üîó **Connection to Session Theme**

This message reinforces the systematic approach that characterized the entire session:
- **Comprehensive Review**: Checking all work completed

- **Quality Assurance**: Ensuring nothing was missed

## ‚è≠Ô∏è **Transition**
This content verification led naturally to the next message requesting systematic organization of the entire conversation history.

## üìö **Related Files**
- `src/prompts/index.ts` - Contains the 6 MCP prompts we modularized
- [06 - Message History Analysis Request](./06-message-history-analysis.md) - Next message

## üéØ **Outcome**
This clarification helped distinguish between different types of prompts and confirmed that our focus was on MCP prompts for the GitHub project management system, not conversation management prompts for the broader orchestr8r vision.
