> 1. Add a numeric prefix (01_, 02_, etc.) to maintain logical order
> 2. Use descriptive filenames that reflect each prompt's purpose
> 3. Maintain the original markdown formatting
> 
> Additionally, create an `index.md` file in this directory that:
> 1. Briefly explains the purpose of these conversation management prompts

> 
> Please confirm when these files have been created with their full paths.
