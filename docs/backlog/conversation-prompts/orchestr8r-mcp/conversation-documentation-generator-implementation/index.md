## Conversation Flow Description

This conversation session focuses on implementing an automated conversation documentation generator system. The session demonstrates a meta-approach to conversation management, where the user requests a system to organize and document conversations themselves.

### Phase 1: Context Establishment (Message 1)
The session begins with the user providing context about having a specific file open (`prompts/conversation-prompts-with-details.md`), establishing the workspace context for the conversation.

### Phase 2: Feature Request (Message 2)
The user presents a detailed specification for a conversation documentation generator that can:
- Analyze conversation themes automatically
- Extract and organize user messages chronologically
- Create themed folder structures
- Generate comprehensive index files with navigation

## Key Technical Requirements

### System Architecture
- **Root Directory**: `/Users/LenMiller/code/banno/orchestr8r-mcp/docs/backlog/conversation-prompts`
- **File Organization**: Themed folders with numerical prefixes
- **Format**: Markdown with metadata headers
- **Navigation**: Relative links for local file system compatibility

### Core Features
1. **Theme Analysis**: Automated extraction of conversation themes
2. **Message Organization**: Chronological preservation with context
3. **Folder Structure**: Theme-based organization system
4. **Index Generation**: Comprehensive navigation and metadata

### Implementation Approach
- Analyze entire conversation history for theme identification
- Extract user messages while preserving exact content and context
- Create descriptive folder names reflecting conversation themes
- Generate individual markdown files with metadata headers
- Build comprehensive index with clickable navigation

## Organizational Patterns

### File Naming Convention
- Numerical prefixes for chronological ordering
- Descriptive names reflecting message content
- Consistent markdown extension usage

### Metadata Structure
- Message type classification
- Timestamp information
- User intent analysis
- Technical details and context

### Navigation Design
- Table of contents with relative links
- Descriptive file summaries
- Message type categorization
- Conversation flow documentation
