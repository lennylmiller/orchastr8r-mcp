# Substrate Layer Example: Lit Components Roadmap

## Based on Your Actual Roadmap

This example shows how to recreate your Lit components roadmap using the Substrate Layer of Resolution pattern.

### Project Configuration
```yaml
project:
  title: "Lit Components: Journey to Production"
  shortDescription: "Phased implementation of Lit-based component library from POC to production"
  timeline:
    start: "2025-01-01"
    end: "2025-08-31"
  view: "roadmap"
```

### Phase Definitions

#### Phase I: Journey towards proof of concept (POC)
```yaml
phase:
  number: "I"
  title: "Journey towards proof of concept (POC)"

  objectives:
    - "Validate Lit framework for our use case"
    - "Create basic component architecture"
    - "Establish development patterns"
  deliverables:
    - "POC implementation with 3-5 sample components"
    - "Technical feasibility report"
    - "Architecture decision record (ADR)"
  dependencies: []
  status: "completed"
```

#### Phase II: Implement Lit equivalent MDS lo-fi components
```yaml
phase:
  number: "II"
  title: "Implement Lit equivalent MDS lo-fi components"
  duration: 3
  objectives:
    - "Port existing MDS components to Lit"
    - "Establish component patterns"
    - "Create lo-fi versions for rapid iteration"
  deliverables:
    - "Complete set of lo-fi MDS components in Lit"
    - "Component documentation"
    - "Migration guide from existing components"
  dependencies: ["I"]
  status: "completed"
```

#### Phase II (parallel): Lo-res theming
```yaml
phase:
  number: "II"
  title: "Lo-res theming"
  duration: 2
  objectives:
    - "Implement basic theming system"
    - "Support light/dark modes"
    - "Establish CSS custom properties structure"
  deliverables:
    - "Theme provider component"
    - "Base theme definitions"
    - "Theme switching demo"
  dependencies: ["I"]
  status: "completed"
```

#### Phase IV: Implement Lit equivalent lo-fi SignUp/SignIn Page
```yaml
phase:
  number: "IV"
  title: "Implement Lit equivalent lo-fi SignUp/SignIn Page"
  duration: 3
  objectives:
    - "Create complete auth flow using Lit components"
    - "Demonstrate component composition"
    - "Validate form handling patterns"
  deliverables:
    - "SignUp page implementation"
    - "SignIn page implementation"
    - "Form validation framework"
    - "Auth flow documentation"
  dependencies: ["II"]
  status: "in_progress"
```

#### Phase V: Hi-res Theming
```yaml
phase:
  number: "V"
  title: "Hi-res Theming"
  duration: 3
  objectives:
    - "Implement production-quality theming"
    - "Add brand customization support"
    - "Performance optimization for theme switching"
  deliverables:
    - "Production theme system"
    - "Multiple theme presets"
    - "Theme customization tools"
    - "Performance benchmarks"
  dependencies: ["II", "IV"]
  status: "not_started"
```

#### Phase VI: Implment Lit equivalent MMDS hi-fi components
```yaml
phase:
  number: "VI"
  title: "Implment Lit equivalent MMDS hi-fi components"
  duration: 4
  objectives:
    - "Create production-ready component library"
    - "Full MMDS parity with enhanced features"
    - "Comprehensive testing and documentation"
  deliverables:
    - "Complete hi-fi component library"
    - "Storybook documentation"
    - "Migration tools and guides"
    - "Performance test results"
  dependencies: ["V"]
  status: "not_started"
```

## Creation Script

```bash
# Using orchestr8r-mcp functions

# 1. Create the project
create-project \
  --ownerId "YOUR_OWNER_ID" \
  --title "Lit Components: Journey to Production" \
  --shortDescription "Phased implementation of Lit-based component library from POC to production"

# 2. Add Phase I
add-draft-issue \
  --projectId "PROJECT_ID" \
  --title "Phase I: Journey towards proof of concept (POC)" \
  --body "## Objectives\n- Validate Lit framework for our use case\n- Create basic component architecture\n- Establish development patterns\n\n## Deliverables\n- POC implementation with 3-5 sample components\n- Technical feasibility report\n- Architecture decision record (ADR)\n\n## Duration: 4 weeks"

# 3. Add Phase II (Components)
add-draft-issue \
  --projectId "PROJECT_ID" \
  --title "Phase II: Implement Lit equivalent MDS lo-fi components" \
  --body "## Objectives\n- Port existing MDS components to Lit\n- Establish component patterns\n- Create lo-fi versions for rapid iteration\n\n## Deliverables\n- Complete set of lo-fi MDS components in Lit\n- Component documentation\n- Migration guide\n\n## Duration: 3 weeks\n\n## Dependencies\n- Phase I must be completed"

# Continue for all phases...
```

## Lessons from This Example

1. **Parallel Phases**: Notice Phase II has two parallel work streams (components and theming)
2. **Clear Dependencies**: Phase IV depends on Phase II, Phase V depends on II and IV
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: lo-fi → hi-fi approach allows for iteration
4. **Measurable Deliverables**: Each phase has concrete outputs
5. **Flexible Numbering**: Phase III might have been removed/merged, showing adaptability

## Reusability

To create a similar roadmap for a different project:
1. Keep the 6-phase structure but adjust titles
2. Maintain the POC → Implementation → Enhancement flow
3. Adjust durations based on complexity
4. Update deliverables to match your domain

This pattern works well for:
- Component library development
- Platform migrations
- Feature rollouts
- Infrastructure upgrades
- Process improvements
