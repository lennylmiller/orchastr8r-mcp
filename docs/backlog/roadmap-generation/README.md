# Substrate Layer of Resolution - Roadmap Generation Toolkit

## Overview
The Substrate Layer of Resolution is a systematic approach to creating phased, high-level roadmaps in GitHub Projects. This toolkit provides templates, prompts, scripts, and configurations for generating consistent, repeatable roadmaps.

## What's Included

### 1. **substrate-layer-roadmap-template.md**
The master template defining the Substrate Layer pattern:
- Core concept explanation
- Phase structure templates
- Standard phase patterns (I-VI)
- GitHub Projects API mapping
- Future automation hooks

### 2. **phased-roadmap-prompt-generator.md**
Parameterized prompt system for creating roadmaps:
- Primary prompt template
- Phase generator prompts
- Quick start examples
- Parameter definitions
- JSON structure for automation

### 3. **github-projects-roadmap-script.md**
Executable scripts using orchestr8r-mcp functions:
- Step-by-step project creation
- Function reference guide
- Command sequences
- Real-world examples
- Integration tips

### 4. **substrate-layer-example-lit-components.md**
Concrete example based on actual roadmap:
- Complete 6-phase Lit components roadmap
- YAML configurations
- Creation scripts
- Lessons learned
- Reusability patterns

### 5. **roadmap-parameters-config.json.md**
Configuration management system:
- Master configuration template
- Pre-built configurations (6-phase, 4-phase MVP, migration)
- Automation integration points
- Best practices

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Choose Your Approach
- **Manual Creation**: Use the prompt generator to create via GitHub UI
- **Script Creation**: Use the script templates with orchestr8r-mcp
- **Automated Creation**: Use JSON configs for repeatable generation

### Step 2: Select a Pattern
1. **Standard 6-Phase**: For comprehensive projects (20-26 weeks)
2. **Rapid 4-Phase**: For MVPs and quick iterations (12 weeks)
3. **Migration Pattern**: For modernization projects (26+ weeks)

### Step 3: Customize Your Roadmap
1. Copy the appropriate template
2. Fill in your project-specific details
3. Adjust phases, durations, and dependencies
4. Define clear objectives and deliverables

### Step 4: Create in GitHub
```bash
# Using orchestr8r-mcp
1. Get your owner ID
2. Run create-project command
3. Add phases as draft issues
4. Configure timeline view
5. Set up custom fields
```

## The Substrate Layer Concept

The "Substrate Layer of Resolution" represents the foundational planning layer where:
- **High-level phases** are defined before detailed tasks
- **Dependencies** are mapped between major milestones  
- **Time horizons** are established for strategic planning
- **Success criteria** are defined at the phase level

This approach provides:
- Clear project structure
- Predictable milestone tracking
- Flexibility within phases
- Strategic alignment

## Typical Phase Flow

```
Phase I: Foundation/POC
    ↓
Phase II: Core Implementation
    ↓
Phase III: Integration
    ↓
Phase IV: Enhancement
    ↓
Phase V: Optimization
    ↓
Phase VI: Production Ready
```

## Future Enhancements

As orchestr8r-mcp evolves, these tools will support:
- Fully automated project generation
- Dynamic timeline calculation
- Dependency validation
- Progress rollup and reporting
- AI-assisted phase planning
- Template marketplace

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Why**: Define clear project goals before phases
2. **Keep Phases Balanced**: 2-6 weeks per phase works best
3. **Define Concrete Deliverables**: Each phase needs measurable outputs
4. **Include Buffer Time**: Add 20-25% buffer for unknowns
5. **Review and Adjust**: Roadmaps are living documents

## Integration with orchestr8r-mcp

Current capabilities:
- Create projects and draft issues
- Set up custom fields
- Basic automation hooks

Coming soon:
- Full roadmap generation from JSON
- Progress tracking automation
- Status update reminders
- Dependency management
- Resource allocation

## Contributing

To extend these tools:
1. Add new configuration templates
2. Create domain-specific examples
3. Enhance automation scripts
4. Document additional patterns

## Support

- Review the examples for guidance
- Check orchestr8r-mcp documentation
- Adapt templates to your needs
- Keep configurations version controlled
