# Comprehensive MCP Project Documentation Strategy

This directory contains a complete documentation strategy for MCP-based projects with both CLI and web interfaces. The strategy balances immediate documentation needs with future growth and scalability.

## Contents

- [Documentation Framework](./framework.md) - Recommended frameworks and their application
- [Documentation Hierarchy](./hierarchy.md) - Directory structure and organization
- [Content Recommendations](./content-recommendations.md) - Specific content for each section
- [Implementation Roadmap](./implementation-roadmap.md) - Phased approach to implementation
- [Implementation Examples](./examples.md) - Successful examples from similar projects
- [Planning Structure](./planning-structure.md) - Structure for planning documentation

## Templates

- [ADR Template](./templates/adr-template.md) - Template for Architecture Decision Records
- [Feature Planning Template](./templates/feature-planning-template.md) - Template for feature planning

## Quick Start

1. Begin with the [Implementation Roadmap](./implementation-roadmap.md) to plan your documentation rollout
2. Set up the basic [Documentation Hierarchy](./hierarchy.md) in your project
3. Use the [Templates](./templates/) for immediate documentation needs
4. Refer to [Content Recommendations](./content-recommendations.md) when developing section content

## Integration with Development

For maximum effectiveness, this documentation strategy should be integrated with your development workflow:

- Include documentation updates in sprint planning
- Require documentation for new features
- Review documentation as part of code review process
- Version documentation alongside code releases

## Maintenance

This documentation strategy should be treated as a living document. Review and update it regularly as your project evolves and your documentation needs change.
