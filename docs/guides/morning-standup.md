## Configuration

Edit these constants in the script:

```typescript
const PROJECT_ID = 'PVT_kwHOAALNNc4A5x3U'; // Your project ID
const STATUS_FIELD_ID = 'PVTSSF_lAHOAALNNc4A5x3UzguhPIo'; // Status field
```

## Primary Focus Feature

The primary focus helps you stay on track:

1. **Set Focus**: Marks one item as your main priority
2. **Persistent**: Survives across standup runs
3. **Visual**: Shows with <¯ emoji
4. **Time Tracking**: Shows when focus was set

## Tips

- Run first thing in the morning
- Use `--set-focus` after standup to commit to a task
- Review blocked items before starting new work
- Track velocity trends week over week

## Customization

You can customize:
- Sprint duration (default: 14 days)
- Priority order (P0, P1, P2)
- Size to points mapping
- Status categories

## Troubleshooting

If no items appear:
1. Check PROJECT_ID matches your project
2. Verify GITHUB_TOKEN has project access
3. Ensure project has items with Status field
