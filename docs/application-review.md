## Tool Analysis

The application implements 29 tools for GitHub Projects V2 management:

- 2 repository tools (commented out/disabled)
- 27 active project and issue management tools

Key tool categories:
- Project CRUD operations
- Field management
- Item management
- Status updates
- Draft issue handling
- Template management

## Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture:
- Uses MCP SDK for server implementation
- Communicates via StdioServerTransport
- Uses Zod for schema validation
- Organizes operations by domain (issues, projects, repositories)
- Implements GraphQL operations for GitHub API interaction

## Recommendations

1. **Repository Tools**: Consider uncommenting and enabling the repository tools for a more complete GitHub integration.

2. **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling for API operations.

3. **Response Formatting**: Consider formatting tool responses for better readability instead of raw JSON.

4. **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments to prompt and tool definitions.

5. **Testing**: Implement unit tests for each prompt and tool.

## Conclusion

Orchestr8r-MCP is a well-structured MCP server that provides comprehensive GitHub Projects V2 management capabilities. All 6 prompts are properly implemented and functional, along with 27 active tools (out of 29 total, with 2 commented out).

The application demonstrates good use of the MCP protocol and provides valuable AI-powered project management capabilities.
