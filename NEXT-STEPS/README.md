# 🚀 Orchestr8r-MCP Immediate Next Steps

## Overview
This directory contains the immediate action plan for expanding orchestr8r-mcp based on the proven success of `morning-standup.ts`. Each item here represents a concrete, measurable improvement that can be implemented within days.

## 📋 Priority Order (Next 7 Days)

### Day 1-2: Core Workflow Scripts
1. **start-my-day.ts** - Enhanced morning routine with automatic task assignment
2. **complete-task.ts** - Mark tasks done and suggest next priority
3. **context-switch.ts** - Save current context and load new task

### Day 3-4: End-of-Day Automation  
4. **end-of-day.ts** - Wrap up current work and plan tomorrow
5. **weekly-review.ts** - Generate weekly progress report

### Day 5-6: Confidence Scoring
6. **confidence-scoring/** - Port FRVPOV engine from inner-agility
7. **calculate-confidence-tool.ts** - New MCP tool for scoring

### Day 7: Integration
8. **quick-dashboard/** - Simple Express server for daily view
9. **package-scripts.ts** - Combine scripts into workflows

## 📊 Success Metrics

Each script must demonstrate:
- ⏱️ **Time Saved**: Minimum 2 minutes per use
- 📈 **Usage Frequency**: Used at least once daily
- ✅ **Success Rate**: Works 95%+ of the time
- 🎯 **Clear Value**: Solves a real daily pain point

## 🛠️ Implementation Pattern

All scripts follow the proven `morning-standup.ts` pattern:
1. Clear purpose and documentation
2. Command-line arguments for flexibility
3. Formatted console output with emojis
4. Time savings reported at the end
5. Actionable recommendations

## 🎯 Getting Started

1. Review `implementation-guide.md` for detailed patterns
2. Start with `start-my-day.ts` - it builds directly on morning-standup
3. Test each script thoroughly before moving to the next
4. Track time savings in each script's output

## 💡 Remember

- **Ship daily** - Working code > Perfect architecture
- **Measure impact** - Time saved is the key metric
- **Stay focused** - Don't add features until core works
- **Build on success** - Each script uses proven patterns
