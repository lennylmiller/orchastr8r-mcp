# Roadmap

## Philosophy: Ship Daily, Build Weekly, Plan Monthly

> "Working code > Perfect architecture. Each day should deliver tangible value to developers."

## Visual Timeline

```
Week 1: Scripts        Week 2-3: Architecture    Month 2-3: Intelligence    Month 4-6: Multi-Service
[====] 30min/day  →   [========] Plugin/Cache →  [========] AI Scoring  →   [========] AODL Vision
  ↑                         ↑                           ↑                          ↑
TODAY                   Refactor                   Dashboard                 Orchestration
```

## Week 1: Immediate Value (Days 1-7)

### Goal: Save 30+ minutes daily through automation scripts

#### Day 1-2: Core Workflow Scripts ✅
- [x] Deploy `start-my-day.ts` - Auto-assign highest priority task
- [ ] Deploy `complete-task.ts` - Mark done & suggest next
- [ ] Deploy `context-switch.ts` - Save/restore work context

```bash
# Move scripts to production
mv NEXT-STEPS/scripts/*.ts src/scripts/
bun test src/scripts/
```

#### Day 3-4: End-of-Day Automation
- [ ] Create `end-of-day.ts` - Summarize work, plan tomorrow
- [ ] Create `weekly-review.ts` - Sprint velocity report

#### Day 5-6: Confidence Scoring
- [ ] Port FRVPOV engine from NEXT-STEPS
- [ ] Add `calculate-confidence` MCP tool
- [ ] Test AI task recommendations

#### Day 7: Integration
- [ ] Deploy quick dashboard (Express + HTML)
- [ ] Create `orchestr8r` CLI combining all scripts
- [ ] Measure and document time savings

### Success Metrics
- ⏱️ 30+ minutes saved daily
- 📊 5 working automation scripts
- 🎯 Team using scripts daily

## Week 2-3: Architecture Refactoring

### Goal: Transform monolithic code into scalable plugin architecture

#### Week 2: Plugin System
```typescript
// From 770-line index.ts to modular plugins
class ProjectsPlugin implements MCPPlugin {
  tools = [/* 17 project tools */];
}
server.registerPlugin(new ProjectsPlugin());
```

- [ ] Extract tool groups into plugins
- [ ] Implement plugin interface
- [ ] Add dependency injection
- [ ] Achieve <100 lines in index.ts

#### Week 3: Production Hardening
- [ ] Add multi-level caching (L1 memory, L2 Redis)
- [ ] Implement circuit breakers
- [ ] Add structured logging
- [ ] Create health check endpoints
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests (80% coverage)

### Success Metrics
- 📦 5+ modular plugins
- 🧪 80% test coverage
- ⚡ <200ms response time (p95)

## Month 2-3: Workflow Intelligence

### Goal: AI-powered task management and team coordination

#### Sprint 3-4: Enhanced Automation
- [ ] Natural language commands ("Start my day", "Ship it")
- [ ] AI confidence scoring for all tasks
- [ ] Automatic task routing based on confidence
- [ ] Git workflow automation (branches, commits, PRs)

#### Sprint 5-6: Team Features  
- [ ] Multi-developer coordination
- [ ] Sprint planning automation
- [ ] Capacity planning with AI
- [ ] Team dashboard with metrics

### Key Deliverables
```typescript
// Natural language interface
orchestr8r "I'm ready to work"
> Starting highest priority task...
> Created branch: feature/user-auth
> Updated status to "In Progress"
> Opening issue in browser...
```

### Success Metrics
- 🤖 70% of tasks have confidence scores
- 👥 3+ team members using daily
- 📈 20% sprint velocity increase

## Month 4-6: Multi-Service Architecture

### Goal: Complete AODL vision with specialized services

#### Service Breakdown
```
orchestr8r-cli
    ├── orchestr8r-mcp (this project)
    ├── git-ops-mcp (new)
    ├── context-mcp (new)
    └── mcp-aggregator (new)
```

#### Sprint 7-8: Core Services
- [ ] Create git-ops-mcp for Git automation
- [ ] Build context-mcp for state management
- [ ] Implement MCP aggregator pattern
- [ ] Deploy services to Kubernetes

#### Sprint 9-12: Advanced Features
- [ ] Multi-AI agent coordination
- [ ] Conductor's dashboard
- [ ] Cross-project dependencies
- [ ] Enterprise features (SSO, audit)

### Success Metrics
- 🏗️ 4 production MCP services
- 🎯 45-60 minutes saved daily
- 🚀 99.9% uptime
- 💯 Full AODL vision realized

## GitHub Projects Integration

Use Project #10 (Sprint Development - Orchestr8r) to track progress:

```bash
# Create sprint iterations
gh project item-create 10 --title "Week 1: Automation Scripts"
gh project item-create 10 --title "Week 2-3: Architecture"
gh project item-create 10 --title "Month 2-3: Intelligence"
```

### Sprint Structure
- **Iterations**: 2-week sprints
- **Milestones**: Monthly deliverables
- **Epics**: Quarterly themes
- **Fields**: Confidence Score, Time Saved, Story Points

## Next Actions

### Today
1. Run `mv NEXT-STEPS/scripts/*.ts src/scripts/`
2. Test `start-my-day.ts` with your team
3. Update PROJECT_ID in scripts

### This Week
1. Deploy all 5 scripts
2. Measure time savings
3. Gather team feedback
4. Start plugin refactoring

### This Month
1. Complete architecture refactoring
2. Add production features
3. Launch dashboard
4. Document API

## Repository Evolution

```

## Success Criteria

The roadmap succeeds when:
1. **Daily**: Developers save 45-60 minutes
2. **Weekly**: New automation ships
3. **Monthly**: Architecture improves
4. **Quarterly**: Vision progresses

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Over-engineering | Ship daily, refactor weekly |
| Scope creep | Focus on time savings metric |
| Team adoption | Start with early adopters |
| Technical debt | Allocate 20% time to refactoring |

*Remember: Every feature must demonstrate measurable time savings. Ship daily.*
