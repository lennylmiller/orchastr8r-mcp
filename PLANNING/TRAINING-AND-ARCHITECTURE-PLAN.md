        "GITHUB_OWNER": "your_username"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Step 2: First Commands - Project Discovery
```
User: "Use orchestr8r to list my GitHub projects"
Claude: [Uses list-projects tool to show all projects]

User: "Show me details about project #10"
Claude: [Uses get-project tool to display Sprint Development - Orchestr8r]

User: "What fields does this project have?"
Claude: [Uses get-project-fields to list all available fields]
```

#### Exercise 1: Project Exploration
1. List your projects and pick one to work with
2. Examine its fields, columns, and current items
3. Understand the workflow states (Todo, In Progress, Done)

### Module 2: Sprint Management Lifecycle (45 minutes)

#### Step 1: Creating a Sprint-Ready Project
```
User: "Create a new sprint project for my team"
Claude: [Uses create-sprint-project prompt to guide creation]

User: "Add iteration field for 2-week sprints starting Monday"
Claude: [Uses create-project-field to add iteration field]

User: "Add priority field with Critical, High, Medium, Low options"
Claude: [Uses create-project-field to add single-select field]
```

#### Step 2: Managing Sprint Items
```
User: "Add these tasks to the current sprint:
- Implement user authentication
- Fix login bug #123
- Update API documentation"
Claude: [Uses add-draft-issue for each task]

User: "Set the login bug as Critical priority"
Claude: [Uses update-project-item-field to set priority]

User: "Move authentication task to In Progress"
Claude: [Uses update-project-item-field to update status]
```

#### Exercise 2: Sprint Setup
1. Create a project with sprint fields (iteration, priority, story points)
2. Add 5-7 tasks representing a typical sprint
3. Assign priorities and story points
4. Move items through the workflow

### Module 3: Daily Workflow Automation (45 minutes)

#### Step 1: Morning Standup
```
User: "Run my morning standup"
Claude: [Uses orchestr8r morning standup script equivalent]
- Shows sprint progress
- Lists your assigned tasks
- Identifies blockers
- Suggests focus for the day
```

#### Step 2: Task Management
```
User: "I'm starting work on the authentication task"
Claude: 
- Updates status to "In Progress"
- Creates feature branch (if Git Ops available)
- Opens relevant files

User: "I finished the authentication task"
Claude:
- Updates status to "Done"
- Logs time spent
- Suggests next task based on priority
```

#### Step 3: End of Day Wrap-up
```
User: "Wrap up my day"
Claude:
- Summarizes completed work

- Prepares tomorrow's focus list
- Generates standup notes
```

#### Exercise 3: Complete Daily Cycle
1. Run morning standup
2. Work through 2-3 tasks with status updates
3. Handle a "blocked" scenario
4. Execute end-of-day wrap-up

### Module 4: Advanced Features (60 minutes)

#### Step 1: Bulk Operations
```
User: "Move all Critical bugs to In Progress"
Claude: [Uses bulk-update-project-item-field for efficiency]

User: "Archive all completed items from last sprint"
Claude: [Filters and uses archive-project-item for each]
```

#### Step 2: Sprint Planning
```
User: "Help me plan the next sprint"
Claude: [Uses prepare-sprint-plan prompt]
- Reviews velocity from previous sprints
- Suggests items from backlog

## Part 2: Deep Dive Developer Tutorial - Understanding the Architecture Through Code

### Introduction

This section provides a hands-on exploration of orchestr8r-mcp's codebase through debugging sessions. We'll examine the strengths and weaknesses by setting breakpoints at strategic locations and tracing through actual execution paths. This Socratic approach will prepare you for the architectural recommendations in Part 3.

### Prerequisites for This Tutorial

1. **Build the debug version**:
```bash
cd /path/to/orchestr8r-mcp
bun run build:debug
```

2. **Configure Claude Desktop for debugging** (from DEBUGGING.md):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "orchestr8r-debug": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "--inspect=9229",
        "--enable-source-maps",
        "/path/to/orchestr8r-mcp/build/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "ghp_your_token",
        "GITHUB_OWNER": "your_username"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Open VS Code** and attach debugger to port 9229

### Tutorial 1: Understanding the Monolithic Structure

#### Setting Our First Breakpoint

Open `src/index.ts` and set a breakpoint at line 43:

```typescript
// Line 43: The schema-to-tool registration mapping
const schemaToToolName: Record<string, keyof typeof operations> = {
  // Breakpoint here ðŸ”´
  getProject: 'getProject',
  listProjects: 'listProjects',
  // ... 27 more mappings
};
```

**Question**: Why do we need this manual mapping? What does this tell us about the architecture?

**Let's Debug**: 
1. Start Claude Desktop with the debug config
2. In Claude, type: "List my GitHub projects"
3. Watch the debugger pause at our breakpoint

**Observation**: This mapping exists because:
- Tool names in MCP must match the schema names
- Operations are defined separately from their registrations
- No automatic discovery mechanism

**Weakness Identified**: Manual maintenance of 29+ mappings is error-prone

#### Tracing Tool Registration

Set a breakpoint at line 72 where tools are registered:

```typescript
// Line 72: Tool registration loop
for (const [schemaName, toolName] of Object.entries(schemaToToolName)) {
  const schema = schemas[schemaName as keyof typeof schemas];
  // Breakpoint here ðŸ”´
  if (!schema) {
    console.error(`Schema ${schemaName} not found`);
    continue;
  }
```

**Step Through** the loop and observe:
1. How many times does this loop execute? (29 times)
2. What happens if a schema is missing?
3. How are errors handled?

**Strength Identified**: Defensive programming with schema validation
**Weakness Identified**: Console.error instead of proper error handling

### Tutorial 2: Exploring the Operations Layer

#### Understanding GitHub Client Integration

Open `src/operations/github-client.ts` and set a breakpoint at line 25:

```typescript
async graphql<T = any>(query: string, variables?: any): Promise<T> {
  try {
    // Breakpoint here ðŸ”´
    const result = await this.octokit.graphql<T>(query, variables);
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('GraphQL request failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

**Exercise**: 
1. Trigger a project query: "Show me project #10"
2. Inspect the `query` parameter - what do you see?
3. Inspect the `variables` - what's being passed?

**Key Learning**: Every operation goes through this single point. This is both:
- **Strength**: Central point for logging, caching, error handling
- **Weakness**: No caching implemented, basic error handling

#### Examining Type Safety

Open `src/operations/projects.ts` and set a breakpoint at line 816:

```typescript
export const projectFieldValueSchema = z.union([
  z.object({
    text: z.string().describe('The text to set on the field')
  }),
  z.object({
    number: z.number().describe('The number to set on the field')
  }),
  // Breakpoint here ðŸ”´
  z.object({
    date: z.string().describe('The ISO 8601 date to set on the field')
  }),
  // ... more field types
]);
```

**Debug Exercise**:
1. Update a field value: "Set priority to High on item X"
2. Watch how Zod validates the input
3. What happens with invalid input?

**Strength Identified**: Comprehensive runtime validation
**Question**: Why do we need runtime validation when we have TypeScript?

### Tutorial 3: GraphQL Query Loading Pattern

#### Understanding the Build-Time Magic

Open `build.ts` and set a breakpoint at line 16:

```typescript
const graphqlPlugin: Plugin = {
  name: 'graphql-loader',
  setup(build) {
    build.onLoad({ filter: /\.graphql$/ }, async (args) => {
      // Breakpoint here ðŸ”´
      const contents = await fs.promises.readFile(args.path, 'utf8');
      return {
        contents: `export default ${JSON.stringify(contents)}`,
        loader: 'js',
      };
    });
  },
};
```

**This Won't Hit During Runtime!** This is build-time code. Instead:

1. Look at `build/index.js` and search for "mutation CreateProjectV2"
2. Notice how GraphQL files become string literals

**Strength**: Zero runtime overhead for loading queries
**Weakness**: No query validation at build time

### Tutorial 4: The Missing Abstraction Layer

#### Where Services Should Be

Set a breakpoint in `src/index.ts` at line 90:

```typescript
server.tool(
  toolName as any,
  schema as any,
  async (args: unknown) => {
    // Breakpoint here ðŸ”´
    const operation = operations[toolName as keyof typeof operations];
    const result = await operation(args);
```

**Debug Exercise**:
1. Execute any tool command
2. Step into the operation call
3. Notice the direct coupling

**Question**: What's missing between the MCP tool and the operation?

**Answer**: A service layer that could provide:
- Caching
- Retry logic
- Transaction support
- Audit logging

### Tutorial 5: Error Handling Deep Dive

#### The Unused Error System

Open `src/common/errors.ts` and observe:

```typescript
export class OrchestrationError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public code: string,
    public details?: unknown
  ) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'OrchestrationError';
  }
}
```

Now search the codebase for `OrchestrationError` usage:
```bash
grep -r "OrchestrationError" src/ --include="*.ts" | grep -v "errors.ts"
```

**Result**: No matches! These errors are defined but never thrown.

**Set a breakpoint** in `src/operations/projects.ts` at line 254:

```typescript
async updateProjectItemFieldValue(params: UpdateProjectItemFieldValueParams) {
  // What happens if this fails?
  const result = await this.client.graphql<UpdateProjectItemFieldValueMutation>(
    UPDATE_PROJECT_ITEM_FIELD_VALUE,
    params
  );
  // Breakpoint here ðŸ”´
  return result.updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue;
}
```

**Exercise**: Force an error (use an invalid field ID) and observe:
1. What error is thrown?
2. How is it handled?
3. What does the user see?

### Tutorial 6: Performance Analysis

#### The Missing Cache

Let's trace multiple calls to understand the performance impact:

1. Set a breakpoint in `github-client.ts` at the graphql method
2. Execute these commands in sequence:
   - "Show me project 10"
   - "Show me project 10 again"
   - "What fields does project 10 have?"

**Observation**: Each command hits GitHub's API separately

**Let's Calculate**:
- Average API response time: ~200ms
- Commands in a typical session: ~50
- Wasted time: 10 seconds per session
- With caching: Could reduce to ~2 seconds

### Tutorial 7: Architectural Insights Summary

#### Strengths We've Discovered

1. **Type Safety**: Every layer has proper TypeScript types
2. **Validation**: Zod schemas catch errors early
3. **Modularity**: Clean separation of GraphQL queries
4. **Simplicity**: Easy to understand data flow

#### Weaknesses We've Identified

1. **Monolithic Registration**: 771 lines in index.ts
2. **No Service Layer**: Direct coupling limits extensibility
3. **No Caching**: Every operation hits the API
4. **Unused Error Types**: Defined but not implemented
5. **Basic Error Handling**: Just console.error and rethrow

### Reflection Questions

Before moving to Part 3's recommendations, consider:

1. **Why wasn't caching implemented initially?**
   - Hint: Look at the mutation-heavy operations

2. **Why might the error types be unused?**
   - Hint: Consider the MCP error model

3. **What would break if we split index.ts?**
   - Hint: Think about the registration order

4. **Where would you add logging?**
   - Hint: Which layer sees all operations?

5. **How would you test this code?**
   - Hint: What needs mocking?

### Debugging Commands Cheat Sheet

```bash
# Watch the server logs
tail -f server.log

# See all GraphQL queries
DEBUG=* bun run build/index.js 2>&1 | grep graphql

# Profile performance
time bun run build/index.js

# Check bundle size
ls -lh build/index.js
```

### Key Takeaways

Through this debugging journey, we've discovered that orchestr8r-mcp is:
- **Well-structured** but could benefit from abstraction layers
- **Type-safe** but lacks runtime observability
- **Functional** but missing production-ready features
- **Simple** but at the cost of extensibility

These insights directly inform the architectural recommendations in Part 3.

## Part 3: Modernized Architecture Recommendations

### Current State Analysis

#### Strengths
1. **Well-structured domain separation** - GraphQL queries organized by domain
2. **Type-safe operations** - Comprehensive Zod schemas and TypeScript
3. **Clean MCP implementation** - Follows SDK patterns correctly
4. **Minimal dependencies** - Focused toolset without bloat

#### Critical Gaps
1. **No test coverage** - Highest priority issue
2. **Monolithic index.ts** - 771 lines with all registrations
3. **No error recovery** - Custom errors defined but unused
4. **No caching layer** - Every operation hits GitHub API
5. **No abstraction layers** - Direct coupling between components

### Recommended Architecture

#### Phase 1: Immediate Improvements (Sprint 1-2)

1. **Testing Infrastructure**
```typescript
// tests/setup.ts
import { MockGitHubClient } from './mocks/github-client'
import { TestFixtures } from './fixtures'

// tests/operations/projects.test.ts
describe('ProjectOperations', () => {
  test('should create project with correct fields', async () => {
    const mock = new MockGitHubClient()
    const ops = new ProjectOperations(mock)
    
    const result = await ops.createProject({
      ownerId: 'test-owner',
      title: 'Test Project'
    })
    
    expect(result.project.title).toBe('Test Project')
    expect(mock.mutations).toHaveBeenCalledWith(CREATE_PROJECT)
  })
})
```

2. **Modularize Tool Registration**
```typescript
// src/tools/projects/index.ts
export function registerProjectTools(server: McpServer) {
  // All project-related tool registrations
  registerGetProject(server)
  registerCreateProject(server)
  // ... etc
}

// src/index.ts (reduced from 771 to ~100 lines)
import { registerProjectTools } from './tools/projects'
import { registerIssueTools } from './tools/issues'
import { registerPrompts } from './prompts'

registerProjectTools(server)
registerIssueTools(server)
registerPrompts(server)
```

3. **Implement Caching Layer**
```typescript
// src/cache/index.ts
interface CacheOptions {
  ttl: number
  key: string
}

class QueryCache {
  async get<T>(key: string, fetcher: () => Promise<T>, options: CacheOptions): Promise<T> {
    const cached = await this.storage.get(key)
    if (cached && !this.isExpired(cached)) {
      return cached.data
    }
    
    const fresh = await fetcher()
    await this.storage.set(key, fresh, options.ttl)
    return fresh
  }
}
```

#### Phase 2: IDEATION-DRAFT-0 Extensions (Sprint 3-4)

1. **Add Workflow Operations API**
```typescript
// src/operations/workflow.ts
export class WorkflowOperations {
  constructor(
    private projects: ProjectOperations,
    private cache: QueryCache
  ) {}

  async getCurrentSprint(projectId: string): Promise<Sprint> {
    const fields = await this.projects.getProjectFields(projectId)
    const iterationField = fields.find(f => f.dataType === 'ITERATION')
    
    const items = await this.projects.getProjectItems({
      id: projectId,
      filter: `iteration:@current`
    })
    
    return {
      id: iterationField.configuration.iterations[0].id,
      name: iterationField.configuration.iterations[0].title,
      items: items.nodes,
      startDate: iterationField.configuration.startDate,
      duration: iterationField.configuration.duration
    }
  }

  async getNextRecommendedTask(developerId: string, projectId: string): Promise<Issue> {
    // Implementation using priority, assignee, and blockers
  }

  async getDeveloperMetrics(developerId: string): Promise<DeveloperMetrics> {
    // Aggregate across projects and time
  }
}
```

2. **Service Layer Architecture**
```typescript
// src/services/orchestration.ts
export class OrchestrationService {
  constructor(
    private workflow: WorkflowOperations,
    private git: GitOperations, // Future
    private context: ContextStore // Future
  ) {}

  async executeCommand(command: NLCommand): Promise<Result> {
    const intent = await this.parseIntent(command)
    
    switch (intent.type) {
      case 'START_DAY':
        return this.startDayWorkflow(intent.params)
      case 'COMPLETE_TASK':
        return this.completeTaskWorkflow(intent.params)
      // ... etc
    }
  }
}
```

#### Phase 3: Full AODL Implementation (Sprint 5-8)

1. **Multi-Service Architecture**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml for development
services:
  orchestr8r-mcp:  # Current PROJECT-MGR
    build: ./orchestr8r-mcp
    environment:
      - GITHUB_TOKEN
      
  git-ops-mcp:  # New Git Operations Service
    build: ./git-ops-mcp
    volumes:
      - ~/.gitconfig:/root/.gitconfig:ro
      
  context-store:  # New Context Store Service
    build: ./context-store
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      
  orchestration-api:  # New Orchestration Engine
    build: ./orchestration-api
    depends_on:
      - orchestr8r-mcp
      - git-ops-mcp
      - context-store
      
  nli-cli:  # Natural Language CLI
    build: ./nli-cli
    depends_on:
      - orchestration-api
```

2. **Unified CLI Experience**
```bash
$ aodl start my day

ðŸŒ… Good morning! Starting your development day...

ðŸ“Š Sprint Progress: Day 3/10 (30% complete)
ðŸŽ¯ Your focus: BUG-456 - Fix login redirect
