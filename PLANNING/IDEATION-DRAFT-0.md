# Orchestr8r: AI-Orchestrated Development Lifecycle (AODL)
## Planning Document for Orchestr8r Development

### Executive Summary

This document outlines a vision for Orchestr8r - a comprehensive AI-powered development orchestrator that manages the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) through natural language interfaces. The system aims to simplify developer workflows while maintaining full visibility and control over the development process.

### Vision Statement

Create an intelligent development companion that allows developers to manage their entire workflow through natural language commands, abstracting away mechanical Git operations, project management tasks, and routine decisions while keeping developers informed and in control.

### Core Objectives

1. **Simplification**: Reduce cognitive load by handling Git operations, branch naming, commit messages, and project updates automatically
2. **Consistency**: Enforce team standards and best practices without manual intervention
3. **Productivity**: Enable developers to focus on code by automating routine tasks
4. **Flexibility**: Support multiple workflow styles (trunk-based, feature-branch, hybrid)
5. **Intelligence**: Learn from patterns to provide increasingly relevant assistance

```

### Component Descriptions

#### 1. Natural Language Interface (NLI)
- **Purpose**: Translate developer intent into system actions
- **Key Commands**:
  - `"Start my day"` - Initialize daily workflow
  - `"What should I work on?"` - Task prioritization
  - `"I'm done with this"` - Complete current task
  - `"Wrap up my day"` - End-of-day routine
  - `"Show me the big picture"` - Project overview

#### 2. Workflow Orchestration Engine
- **Purpose**: Coordinate between services to execute complex workflows
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Intent recognition and command routing
  - Workflow state management
  - Multi-step operation coordination
  - Error handling and recovery

#### 3. Service Layers

**Git Operations Service**
- Automated branching with semantic naming
- Intelligent commit message generation
- Merge strategy selection
- Conflict detection and assistance

**PROJECT-MGR Integration**
- GitHub Projects V2 synchronization
- Issue and PR management
- Sprint tracking and updates
- Team collaboration features

**Context Store Service**
- Developer preferences and patterns
- Project state and history
- Work session continuity
- Performance metrics

## Workflow Models

### 1. Trunk-Based AI Flow (Recommended Default)

**Characteristics:**
- Single main branch with short-lived feature branches (<1 day)
- Automatic feature flag management
- Continuous integration focus
- Best for experienced teams with strong CI/CD

**AI Behaviors:**
- Creates branches with pattern: `<type>/<ticket>-<brief-description>`
- Auto-commits at logical breakpoints
- Manages feature flags for incomplete work
- Merges to main multiple times per day

### 2. Structured AI Flow

**Characteristics:**
- Traditional feature branches with PR workflow
- Suitable for teams requiring code review gates
- Better for distributed teams or open-source projects

**AI Behaviors:**
- Creates long-lived feature branches
- Generates comprehensive PR descriptions
- Manages review requests and reminders
- Handles merge conflict resolution assistance

### 3. Hybrid AI Flow

**Characteristics:**
- Combines trunk-based and feature branch approaches
- AI determines strategy based on task complexity
- Balances speed with safety

**AI Behaviors:**
- Quick fixes go directly to trunk
- Features get branches based on size/risk
- Automatically manages feature flags for trunk commits
- Suggests appropriate workflow per task

## Open Questions

1. **Integration Depth**: Should this be built as an extension to PROJECT-MGR or as a wrapper service?
2. **AI Model**: Which LLM should power the natural language interface?
3. **Desktop Integration**: Should we build IDE plugins or stay CLI-focused?
4. **Team Features**: How much multi-developer coordination should v1 include?
5. **Offline Support**: How should the system behave without internet connectivity?

## Next Steps

1. **Gather Feedback**: Present this plan to potential users and iterate
2. **Prototype Core**: Build a minimal CLI demonstrating key workflows
3. **Validate Architecture**: Ensure PROJECT-MGR can support required extensions
4. **Define MVP**: Determine minimum feature set for initial release
5. **Form Team**: Identify contributors and establish governance
