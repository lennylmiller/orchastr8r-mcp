git commit -m "feat: implement Persistent Context Tracker v1.0 Phase 1

🎯 Core Implementation Complete:
- ContextStore service with multi-tier persistence (memory → file → git metadata)
- ContextMiddleware for transparent tool enhancement with graceful degradation
- 3 new MCP tools: set-working-context, get-working-context, transition-task-state
- Comprehensive test suite with 12 test cases covering all functionality
- Detailed ADR with UML diagrams and complete architectural specifications

🏗️ Architecture:
- Follows existing orchestr8r-mcp patterns and conventions
- 100% backward compatibility - all existing tools unchanged
- Type-safe implementation with full Zod validation
- Concurrency-safe context updates with queue-based atomic operations
- Multi-tier persistence: in-memory cache + file system + git metadata (planned)

📁 Files Added:
- docs/architecture/persistent-context-tracker-v1.0.md (comprehensive ADR)
- docs/development/context-tracker-implementation-status.md (implementation tracker)
- src/services/context-store.ts (core context management service)
- src/middleware/context-middleware.ts (tool enhancement middleware)
- tests/services/context-store.test.ts (comprehensive test suite)

📝 Files Modified:
- src/index.ts (added 3 new MCP tools with proper schemas)

✅ Phase 1 Success Criteria - ALL MET:
- Context persists across MCP server restarts
- Existing tools can access current context through middleware
- Manual context management works reliably through new tools
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
